# Vinyl - e-commerse web-site with database functionallity

A classic example of a commercial website with a hint of e-commerse store, where you can browse, buy and add vinyl records of any genre and price category wish you want! ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£

**Coll, isnt it?**) The world is not ready yet for such application!!! (it's a joke ðŸ˜‘).

## Tech stack:
* Front-end: [React](https://reactjs.org), state management - [Redux](https://redux.js.org), client-routing - [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router)
* Back-end (http-api server): [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com),
* Database: MongoDB through [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)
* Async requests: [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* Styling: [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)
* Animations: [React-spring](https://www.react-spring.io) and native css
## Features: 
- [x] Browsing, buying, adding, editing vinyls and genres of music
- [x] Authorization via normal e-mail flow with **JWT**
- [x] Minimalistic implementation of the user profile with history of buying and email/password info
- [x] Search of all products existing in the store
- [ ] Purchase flow via some third-party service with paypal, cards, etc was not implemented for simplicity reasons!  Cause i appreciate your time ðŸ˜‰
- [x] Cool realistic physic-based 3d animation of card by majestic **react-spring** library. I couldn't to not mention it ðŸ˜Š. Sad note: (not working properly in IE, Edge and some versions Safari)
- [x] Adding vinyls and genres of music is the additional feature of the site. The main purpose of this feature - to create aka custom CMS system without any Wordpress etc integration. In near future i'll consider and implement Gatsby Headless approach

That's all the main functionallity presented on the app ðŸ¤˜ Feel free to visit site and trying to edit something. Your private info isnt used anywhere!!! Cause site was created only with educational intention in mind!
